# Replicant Demo UI

This is a user interface that makes it a bit easier to do the same things that are happening in the [CLI demo](../replicant) and to follow what's happening in the demo.

## Setup

1. Do all the setup for the [CLI demo](../replicant)
2. `yarn install`
3. (You're not going to like this bit): `go get github.com/aboodman/ivan && go install github.com/aboodman/ivan`

## Run

```
cd  ../replicant
ivan & # I do not recommend forgetting that this is running
cd -
yarn run start
```
