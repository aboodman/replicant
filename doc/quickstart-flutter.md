# Conflict-Free Offline Sync in 5 Minutes

1. Download and unzip the latest release of the [Replicant Flutter SDK](https://github.com/aboodman/replicant/releases)

2. Add the `replicant` dependency to your pubspec.yaml

3. Add your transaction bundle

4. Instanciate Replicant in your app

5. Execute transactions

Congratulations! You are done now - time for a cup of coffee.

In fact, while you're out, install the app on two devices and let them sync with each other. Disconnect them. Take a subway ride. Whatever. It's all good. Replicant will sync whenever there is connectivity.
