# Conflict-Free Offline Sync in 5 Minutes

1. Download and unzip the latest release of the Replicant Flutter SDK
2. Make `hello-bundle.js` an asset in your Flutter app
  - Copy it into the assets dir
  - Mark the path as an asset in pubspec.yaml
3. Instanciate Replicant in your app
  - You can give it whatever database name you want right now, the replicant service has no auth yet!
4. Execute transactions

There's also a fully-functional Hello World Replicant app demonstrating the above, as well as a more fully-featured TODO app.
