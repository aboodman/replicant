Jepsen has evaluated Replicant's preliminary, internal design documents, but has not evaluated Replicant's actual code or behavior. As of October 25, 2019, Replicant's documentation describes a set of client libraries and an HTTP server for writing stateful, offline-first mobile applications, using arbitrary (but deterministic) JavaScript transactions over a replicated document store. Like [Bayou](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mcorner/courses/691M/papers/terry.pdf) and [Eventually Serializable Data Services](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Lynch/podc96-esds.pdf), Replicant works towards a totally ordered prefix of *final* transactions, while *tentative* transactions, which have not yet been totally ordered, go through a shifting series of [causally consistent](https://jepsen.io/consistency/models/causal) orders after the locally-known final prefix of the total order.

Replicant's state is always the product of *some* order of atomically executed transactions, which simplifies proving some invariants. Tentative transactions execute speculatively, with causal consistency, but may be reordered, and re-executed arbitrarily many times, before their final order is known. This means their safety properties must hold under any (causally consistent) ordering of concurrent and future transactions. Tentative transactions can be thought of as an implementation of [Statebox](https://github.com/mochi/statebox), but with causally consistent transaction ordering. Likewise, any [CRDT](https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00609399v1/document) can be implemented in Replicant tentative transactions alone, making them equivalent to CRDTs. However, Replicant's eventually serializable transaction order provides the ability to *upgrade* selected transactions to [strict serializability](https://jepsen.io/consistency/models/strict-serializable), at the cost of having to block for server acknowledgement. This could allow users to write hybrid commutative & non-commutative systems. Replicant's API does not expose an API for serializable transactions yet, but the listener API could, we suspect, make this possible.

Casual+ is one of the strongest consistency models offline clients can ensure, and Jepsen is pleased to see additional interest in the consistency challenges of distributed mobile computing.
