- bugs:
  - why does first commit in flutter todo app create merge commits? expect fast-forward
  - sync hella slow
  - sync crash on android - permissions error creating temp dir
- todo list samples on {ios/swift, android/java, flutter, and rn} that share a schema and can sync w/ each other
  - core
    x tx reg and execution apis (1-2 wk)
    x run js code (v8? otto?)
    x expose api via js bindings
    x js library to make it minimally easy to use
  x sync (1 wk)
    x local-side sync
  - hook up continuous testing to now
  x server
    x get noms running locally against aws again
    x wrap that into a now-compatible binary - no auth, client specifies db name and server just accepts

later
=====
- detailed sync tests
  - need to invest some little format for describing histories to easily test different ones
- server-side sync
- actual execution environment
- sandboxing
- correctly queuing sync calls
- versioning / migration
- fix noms sync with long commit chains
- gc
  - collapse commit chains beyond some window
  - gc unreachable slabs in nbs
- indexes
- queries
- notif api (2 days)
- blocking notifs
